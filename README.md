# LVGL version 5.3 Documentation Archive for VEX PROS

This is an archive containing some documentation for LVGL (LittleVGL / Light and Versatile Graphics Library) version 5.3, as the PROS toolkit for VEX V5 robots comes with this specific version of LVGL, and it is difficult to find proper documentation for this version.

This is intended to help develop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using LVGL on VEX robots.

Up-to-date documentation for the latest versions of LVGL can be found at [https://docs.lvgl.io/](https://docs.lvgl.io/) or [https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl). Copies of older documentation can be found at [https://github.com/lvgl/docs_old/](https://github.com/lvgl/docs_old/) (although the documentation for version 5.3 can only be found by going through the commits to around late 2018)
