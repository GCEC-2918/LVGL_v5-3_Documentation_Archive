### How to get started?

#### Read the documentation
Reading the documentation first is always a good idea. Don't be afraid it takes only a little time to learn the basics.

You can start here with [Porting](/Porting_tr) or with an [Introduction](/Objects_tr) to the library.

#### Tutorial
There is a tutorial to show you the most important parts step-by-step.

It's located in the [lv_examples repository](https://github.com/littlevgl/lv_examples)

#### Try LittlevGL in a PC simulator
If you don't have an embedded hardware with a display yet you can try the library on PC. The PC simulator uses a window on your monitor to simulate a display and uses your mouse to click on that display.

The simulator is works with Windows, Linux, and OSX as well.

Here you can learn how to set-up the simulator: [PC simulator](/PC-simulator_tr)
